## Why
Japan is beautiful, and so is this website, but the Japanese also understand something about convenience. If this website was a train, it would require you to wait for each door of each carriage to open individually, each with its own animation and introduction. You'd also be required to figure out whether you needed to press a button, swipe a panel, or wave at a sensor to get the door to open. If you take too long, the next door will open.
